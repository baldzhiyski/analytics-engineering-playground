# Data Pipelines Lab

A **training repository** for learning and practicing **data analysis**, **analytics engineering**, and **data engineering / big data pipelines**.

This repo is designed as a hands-on playground to experiment with real-world data workflows — from exploration and SQL modeling to scalable batch and streaming pipelines.

---

## Goals

- Build reliable **ETL / ELT pipelines**
- Understand **batch vs. streaming** data processing
- Practice **analytics engineering** (SQL modeling, transformations)
- Learn **data modeling** concepts (facts, dimensions, SCDs)
- Apply **testing, observability, and CI** principles to data workflows
